Currently pursuing my Masterâ€™s in Data Science at Pace University, I bring over 3 years of experience in software quality assurance and functional testing within agile development environments. My foundation in tech and testing has evolved into a strong interest and growing expertise in data analytics and machine learning.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of my experience and skill set:

âœ… 3+ years of QA experience working across fintech and edtech domains.
âœ… Hands-on experience in data analysis and visualization using Python, SQL, Excel & Power BI
âœ… Trained in machine learning, predictive modeling, A/B testing, and data storytelling
âœ… Strong academic grounding in statistics, database management systems, and data structures
âœ… Previous roles included CI/CD pipeline testing, production support, and integration testing
âœ… Passionate about transforming messy, complex data into clear business solutions

I've worked on impactful data projects including:
ðŸ“Š Customer churn analysis using Random Forest
ðŸ“ˆ Marketing ad-spend analysis and ROI optimization
âš¡ Energy pricing and cost modeling

I enjoy collaborating with cross-functional teams, building data pipelines, and turning business questions into measurable insights. I take initiative, communicate clearly, and thrive in fast-paced environments where learning and growth are constant.
